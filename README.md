### FinancialAPI

This code is an implementation of an API using FastAPI that is used to manage a database of financial transactions. The API defines various endpoints for performing CRUD operations on transactions, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting financial transaction records. The information for each transaction is described using the `Transaction` model, which includes fields such as `id`, `date`, `instrument`, `amount`, `maturity`, `rate`, and `drawer`.

To use this API, a user can perform various actions. For example, by accessing the root path ("/") through a GET request, the user can retrieve a list of all financial transactions stored in the database. Additionally, they can perform specific queries about a transaction using the "/transactions/{id}" path and providing the transaction ID in the URL.

To modify the database, users can add new transactions using a POST request to the root path ("/"). They can also delete transaction records using a DELETE request to the "/transactions/{id}" path and update transaction records using a PUT request to the "/transactions/{id}" path along with the transaction fields they want to update. In summary, this API provides an interface for managing financial data and could later be connected to a database for data persistence and updates.
